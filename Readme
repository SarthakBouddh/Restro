1. QR Code Generation for Each Table
Backend:
Assign a unique code or URL for each table (e.g., /dinein?table=5).
Use a library like qrcode (Node.js) to generate a QR code image for each table’s URL.
Store or display these QR codes (print and place on tables).
Frontend:
Optionally, create a page for admins to download/print QR codes for all tables.

2. Customer Scans QR and Lands on Dine-In Page
Frontend:
Create a /dinein route/page.
When a customer scans the QR, they are taken to /dinein?table=5 (or whatever table number).
On this page, prompt the customer to fill in their info (name, phone, guests).


\3. Customer Info and Table Booking
Frontend:
After submitting info, store it in local state or localStorage.
Mark the table as “Booked” in the backend (send a request to update table status).
Backend:
Update the table’s status to “Booked” and associate it with the customer info.


\\4. Customer Orders from Their Phone
Frontend:
After info is filled, show the menu and allow the customer to add items to their cart and place an order.
When the order is placed, send the order to the backend, associating it with the table and customer.
Backend:
Create a new order, link it to the table and customer, and set its status to “Pending” or “In Progress”.

5. Admin Accepts/Manages Orders
Admin Dashboard:
Show new orders as they come in.
Allow admin to accept, update status, or reject orders.

6. Customer Can See Order Progress
Frontend:
On the customer’s phone, show the current status of their order (e.g., “In Progress”, “Ready”, “Served”).
Poll the backend or use websockets for real-time updates.

7. Customer Can Request Waiter Help
Frontend:
Add a “Call Waiter” button on the customer’s order/progress page.
When clicked, send a request to the backend.
Backend/Admin:
Notify the admin/waiter (e.g., show a notification in the dashboard).
8. Security & Session Management
Use a unique session/token for each customer session (e.g., store in localStorage or as a URL param).
Prevent customers from accessing other tables’ orders.
